# SPECjbb2015

SPECjbb2015 is a Java Client/Server performance testing benchmark.
Please visit its product page for more information, including a user guide: [https://www.spec.org/jbb2015/](https://www.spec.org/jbb2015/).

## Prerequisites

Since SPECjbb requires a license to run, this aqa-test config requires that a licensed copy of the benchmark already exists on the machine that you are running on.

## Run

 Calls [run_specjbb2015.sh](./run/run_specjbb2015.sh) to run the benchmark.
